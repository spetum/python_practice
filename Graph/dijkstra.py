# dijkstra's algorithm
"""
1. Assign to every node a distance value. Set it to zero for our initial node
   and to infinity for all other nodes.
2. Mark all nodes as unvisited. Set initial node as current.
3. For current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their
   tentative distance (from the initial node). For example, if current node
   (A) has distance of 6, and an edge connecting it with another node (B)
   is 2, the distance to B through A will be 6+2=8. If this distance is less
   than the previously recorded distance (infinity in the beginning, zero
   for the initial node), overwrite the distance.
4. When we are done considering all neighbors of the current node, mark it as
   visited. A visited node will not be checked ever again; its distance
   recorded now is final and minimal.
5. If all nodes have been visited, finish. Otherwise, set the unvisited node
   with the smallest distance (from the initial node) as the next "current
   node" and continue from step 3.
